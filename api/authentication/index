<ol>
<li><p>API Key Creation <br/>
Users can create an API key, which will be associated with a secret. The secret will be shown only once during the creation process.</p></li>
<li><p>Signature Generation <br/></p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>For each authenticated request, users need to generate a signature using their secret key. <br/></li>
<li>For GET requests: The data to be signed is the query string, which includes the timestamp and any other query parameters.<br/></li>
<li>For POST/PUT/DELETE requests: The data to be signed is the body of the request, which includes the timestamp, and any other
fields. <br/></li>
<li>The signature is generated by applying HMAC-SHA256 to the data (query string or body) using the user&#39;s secret key. <br/></li>
<li>The generated signature is sent in the request headers along with the API key. <br/></li>
</ul>
