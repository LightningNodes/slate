<h1 id='authentication'>Authentication</h1>

1. API Key Creation <br/>
    Users can create an API key, which will be associated with a secret. The secret will be shown only once during the creation process.


2. Signature Generation <br/>

- For each authenticated request, users need to generate a signature using their secret key. <br/>
- For GET requests: The data to be signed is the query string, which includes the timestamp and any other query parameters.<br/>
- For POST/PUT/DELETE requests: The data to be signed is the body of the request, which includes the timestamp, and any other
fields. <br/>
- The signature is generated by applying HMAC-SHA256 to the data (query string or body) using the user's secret key. <br/>
- The generated signature is sent in the request headers along with the API key. <br/>
